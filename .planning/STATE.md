# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-07)

**Core value:** Hunters can move from signal intake to executable hunts, evidence-grade receipts, publishable findings, promotable detections, and data-backed hunt recommendations inside one consistent workflow surface.
**Current focus:** v3.0 Hunt Program Intelligence — Phase 51: Program Dashboard Extension Wiring

## Current Milestone: v3.0 Hunt Program Intelligence

**Goal:** Restructure program/case hierarchy, build unified MCP server for ATT&CK + Sigma + detection intelligence, enable cross-case memory and knowledge graph persistence.

## Current Position

Phase: 51 of 57 (Program Dashboard Extension Wiring)
Plan: 51-02 (complete) of 2 plans in phase
Status: Complete (2/2 plans complete)
Last activity: 2026-04-08 -- Phase 51 complete (program dashboard webview panel)

Progress: [██████████] 100% (v3.0 Phase 51: 2/2 plans)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- v3.0 Architecture: Option C — unified MCP (@thrunt/mcp-hunt-intel) + native CLI for case memory
- MCP transport: stdio for CLI, optional HTTP wrapper for VS Code extension
- SQLite: dual — per-program DB in .planning/, global ~/.thrunt/intel.db for ATT&CK/Sigma
- Sigma rules: bundle SigmaHQ core rules + support SIGMA_PATHS/SPLUNK_PATHS/ELASTIC_PATHS env vars
- Case memory: global search with program filter (cross-program discovery)
- Knowledge graph: same SQLite DB as detections (co-located for joins)
- Phase 50 MUST complete before any other v3.0 phase (cases/ path resolution is a universal dependency)
- planningDir/planningPaths: case takes precedence over workstream when both provided
- THRUNT_CASE env var checked before THRUNT_WORKSTREAM in fallback chain
- .active-case pointer file at .planning/.active-case (dot-prefixed)
- programState key always resolves to root STATE.md; state key resolves to scoped directory
- case_roster stored in STATE.md frontmatter as array-of-objects, not in separate file
- syncStateFrontmatter preserves existing case_roster to prevent data loss during state sync
- cmdCaseNew uses setActiveCase to auto-switch context to newly created case
- cmdCaseClose clears .active-case pointer if the closed case was active
- [Phase 50]: case_roster stored in STATE.md frontmatter as array-of-objects, not in separate file
- [Phase 50]: syncStateFrontmatter preserves existing case_roster to prevent data loss during sync
- [Phase 50]: cmdCaseNew auto-sets .active-case pointer; cmdCaseClose clears it if active
- [Phase 50]: migrate-case is a top-level command (not under 'case' subgroup) per CONTEXT.md decision
- [Phase 50]: Roster and active-case pointer updates are non-fatal after successful migration file moves
- [Phase 51]: stripCasePrefix applied in toArtifactRelativePath (not resolveArtifactType) so all downstream consumers automatically work for case artifacts
- [Phase 51]: cmdProgramRollup replaces entire body below frontmatter for idempotent re-generation
- [Phase 51]: Stale threshold: 14 days with no activity for active cases
- [Phase 51]: deriveProgramDashboard placed on HuntDataStore class alongside existing derive methods for consistent store-driven pattern
- [Phase 51]: uniqueTechniques set to 0 as placeholder -- technique data requires file reads the store doesn't currently do
- [Phase 51]: case:open navigates to MISSION.md file via vscode.open rather than opening a new workspace window

### Blockers/Concerns

None.

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-04-08T14:06:56Z
Stopped at: Completed 51-02-PLAN.md
Resume: Phase 51 complete. Both plans executed: Plan 01 (watcher case fix + CLI rollup) and Plan 02 (webview panel). All 256 tests pass.
